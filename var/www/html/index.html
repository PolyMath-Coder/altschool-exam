      <h3>
        I am Ayooluwa Adeleke. I am a cloud engineering enthusiast passionate about solving problems with technology.
        A growing software engineer passionate about building out performant backend systems, test-driven APIâ€™s and server-side technology.
        I applied to the AltSchool Cloud Engineering Track because of the passion that I have in becoming a well-rounded Tech expert. 
        As a thriving software engineer,  It is fast becoming apparent that the cloud engineer is an indispensable individual to any product team and is thus 
        vitally important for a software engineer to have in their arsenal of skills as this grants them real-time leverage over other engineers without the skillset.
